What is my hypothesis.

Determine the P-value.

Spend a lot of time on the methods, explain research question, objective, where the data is from. Add citations where applicable. Does the data satisfy the needs of the analysis?  EX: “ I need to do another test because my results aren’t robust enough” 

Linear or logistic regression based on hypothesis and data.

Determine/explain what the indexes are representative of.

Tidy the data, make it longer and compare state by region and make it a categorical variable for a logistic regression: “How likely is it that a state is in a  given region based on the values for fert/pest use”. Or I could compare a state to the national average. 

Remove yield consideration from research question: it is already assumed that pest/fert affects yields.

Potential OVB: is total area represented?  because that affects yield.
